Broadly, I am interested in doing meta-science and teaching reproducible research methods. More specific research interests include meta-analytic methods (especially publication bias and tests of small study effects), peer review, causal inference, psychology/sociology of science.


I am currently writing my [master thesis](https://osf.io/6efcg/) at the department of Methods and Evaluation / Quality Assurance at the FU Berlin. I've been affiliated with [METRICS](https://metrics.stanford.edu/) for a while and am currently involved in three research projects there, with [one of them](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.25.21262631) soon coming to fruition. I will be starting a PhD somewhere in Germany in November or December of this year, in which I will research this meta-scientific topic or the other.

I spend most of my free time nowadays (re)learning maths, trying to be a wee bit less terrible at the piano, and touring Berlin's cemetries.
